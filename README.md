# DecisionMaker

DecisionMaker (name and app icon TBD) is an app that uses weighted average decision making, but hides all of the math from you so you can focus on the vibes of the decision itself.

## Current status

The app is in beta through TestFlight, but currently only works properly on phones. Pad support is planned as a roadmap item, and certainly pre-app-store.

Other things to consider before go-live:
- Pad support as mentioned
- iCloud storage for sharing decisions across devices
- Localization into other languages than English

## Coding Philosophy

This codebase is an experiment in coding with chatGPT. The data layer has been written by me, but the UI has been written mostly by chatGPT 4, based on the data layer and my written specs.
